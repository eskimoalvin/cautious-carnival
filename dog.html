        <section>
          <p>I am the proud owner of a 4 year old puppy. His name is Biggie Paws Notorious D.O.G.</p>
          <p>He is an <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd/"> Australian Shepherd</a>,  <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog/">Blue Heeler</a>, <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/border-collie/">Border Collie </a> mix. Although he is somewhat of a mutt, we love him all the same.</p>
          <p>All Three of the breeds that make him up are very rambunctious breeds. They were all made for herding farm animals.</p>
          <p>This ensures that he always has quite a bit of extra energy. This is fine for when that type of dog works on a farm, ours, however, does not.</p>
          <p>This means that in order to burn off all of that extra energy that he was graced with, we need to spend our free time working him out.</p>
          <p>Some of the things that we do to help him burn off that energy <strong> every day</strong> are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 hour of playtime at the local dog park</li>
            <li>around 30 minutes of "brain games"</li>
            <li>Some kind of walk usually totalling 45 minutes</li>
            <li> <i>lot of belly rubs!</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are things that we do every day to ensure that he does not let his energy out in unconstructive ways.</p>
          <p>Shortly after we got him, we were unaware of the challenges of owning a working dog.</p>
          <p>We found out one day when my wife came downstairs to a ruined couch. We got him a trainer who taught us how to handle our little bundle of crazy shortly after that incident.</p>
          <p>We love Biggie very much despite all the work that he presents. He is a very well behaved dog who loves us and would do anything to keep us safe.</p>
