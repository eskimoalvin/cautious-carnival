    <h2>About My Video Games</h2>

    <section>
    <p>I play a lot of video games, I do most of my gaming on my PC. My PC is built according to the following <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/fTg3cq/">specifications</a></p>
    <p>I do most of my schoolwork on this computer as well as all of my gaming. I have been pc gaming for the last seven or so years.</p>
    <p>In those seven years, I have amassed over 170 games on my <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Buzzbuzzbeeoch/">Steam profile</a>
      <br> I like to play mostly single player games, but do spend a decent amount of time playing multiplayer games.</p>
    <p>Some of my current favorite games are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Among Us</li>
      <li>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR</li>
      <li>Elite Dangerous</li>
      <li>Kenshi</li>
      <li>Rim World</li>
      <li>Sea of Theives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have invested in buying a VR headset recently. I own an <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/"> Oculus Rift.</a></p>
    <p>At first it made me a bit motion sick, but after a couple of hours inside, I have adapted nicely to it.</p>
    <p>I also own a <a href="https://www.thrustmaster.com/en_US/products/tflight-hotas-4/"> Thrustmaster HOTAS 4</a> flight stick. I play on that quite a bit.</p>
    <p>I had bought the flight stick orignally for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. I came to realize that I did not like the game and used the flight stick to play Elite Dangerous.</p>
    <p>I also run and manage my own Discord Gaming Server. It is a place where my friends and I can hang out and talk video games. <br> We frequently get together to play games as a group.</p>
    <p>Finally, when I can find the time, I spend some time streaming on Twitch <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/buzzbuzzbeeoch/"></a>.</p>
